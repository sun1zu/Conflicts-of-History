# Conflicts-of-History

## IMPORTANT!
I won't further publish releases on Github. For downloads please go [here](https://sun1zu.itch.io/conflicts-of-history)

## **Foreword** 
This game is a demo and is far from its official release. Expect and report bugs. To play, you’ll need at least 2 players and a map.

## **Description**
Team up, choose your troops on your app, and position your smartphones them on opposite sides of the map. Your goal is to eliminate the opposing team. To succeed, collaborate with your teammates to strategize and carefully select your units. Each historical event features a unique map and units. Currently, the game includes the Battle of Poltava (1709), but it can be adapted to other historical events. The demo offers 3 unit types for both Russia and Sweden.
